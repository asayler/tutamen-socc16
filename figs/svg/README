This folder holds SVG source files. They can be created or edited with
any vector graphics editor (e.g. InkScape, Google Drawings,
etc). Since SVG graphics are vectorized, they can scale to any
size. But first they need to be converted to PDFs so LaTeX can read them.

To generate PDF figs, run 'make figs' from the repo's top level
directory. InkScape must be installed for this command to work.
