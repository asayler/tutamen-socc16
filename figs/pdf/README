This folder holds automatically generated PDF figures for inclusion in
the report. It will be empty on a fresh git pull since the PDF images
are purposely not tracked by git.

To generate PDF figs, run 'make figs' from the repo's top level
directory. InkScape must be installed for this command to work.
