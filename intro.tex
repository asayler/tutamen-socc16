\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

How best to storage and manager secrets -- the bits of tightly
controlled data necessary to ensure or bootstrap and security of
larger data stores or computing systems -- has always been a
non-trivial problem. As we continue to move toward computing and
storage platforms controlled by third parties and embrace the ideals
of ephemeral infrastructure, the secret storage problems only become
more prevalent and important to answer. Tutamen\footnote{Latin -- A
  means of protection or defense.} is our attempt to solve the secret
storage problem in a manner that allows the user to adhere to a range
of security and privacy requirements.


\subsection{The Need for Secret Storage}

In response to the move toward ephemeral infrastructure, we have
developed and deployed numerous configuration management systems to
store the metadata required to deploy and operate a range of modern
technologies. System such as puppet~\cite{puppet} or chef~\cite{chef}
are designed to manage and configure large fleets of ephemeral
infrastructure. Such systems, however, do not tend to have suitable
mechanisms for storing and controlling access to configuration data
that must remain secret.
