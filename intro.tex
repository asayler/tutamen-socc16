\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

How best to store and manage secrets -- the bits of sensitive data
necessary to bootstrap or ensure the security of computing systems and
services -- has always been a non-trivial problem. As we continue to
move toward computing and storage platforms controlled by third
parties, and embrace modern trends toward ephemeral infrastructure,
the secret-storage problem only becomes more prevalent and critical to
solve.

Tutamen\footnote{Latin for ``A means of protection or defense.''} is
our attempt to solve the secret-storage problem in a manner that
allows the user to adhere to a range of security and privacy
requirements without sacrificing functionality in the process. Tutamen
is a next-generation secret-storage platform. It builds on our
previous secret-storage efforts~\cite{custos-trios} as well as various
secret-storage systems available today~\cite{vault, confidant,
  keywhiz}.

In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation
of Tutamen and its novel features. We also provide several practical
demonstrations of how Tutamen can be integrated with real world
applications to offer desirable features in a secure and easy-to-use
manner. Tutamen's primary selling points include:
\begin{packed_item}
\item A modular authentication system designed to support contextual,
  multi-factor, and alternate-band (e.g., SMS text messages)
  authentication mechanisms.
\item The ability to operate atop minimally trusted infrastructure by
  leveraging multiple storage and access control providers to achieve
  redundancy and mitigate trust.
\item The ability to share and manage secrets beyond the boundaries
  of a single administrative domain.
\end{packed_item}

\subsection{The Need for Secret-Storage}

Computing systems pervade every facet of our lives, from the fitness
trackers on our wrists, to our ``smart'' home appliances, to the
server infrastructure required to support the range of websites and
services we interact with every day. With this explosion of computing
systems has come an equally large explosion in the amount of data
stored by and about us. While some of this data is designed to be
public (e.g., the entries on Wikipedia), much of it is not, requiring
the enforcement of various privacy and security guarantees with
respect to its handling and storage. The basis of providing such
guarantees relies on our ability to store and selectively share
secrets ranging from the keys used to encrypt our data to the
passwords used to protect our online accounts. How best to store and
manage these secrets is thus a critical question, the answer to which
forms the foundation for all of computing's higher level security and
privacy guarantees.

Beyond the need to bootstrap a variety of security guarantees, there
are several other factors driving the need for robust secret-storage
solutions. On the systems administration front, the trend toward
ephemeral infrastructure capable of rapidly scaling up or down is
driving the adoption of configuration management systems such as
Puppet~\cite{puppet} or Chef~\cite{chef}. Such systems, however, do
not tend to have suitable mechanisms for enforcing the security and
privacy requirements inherent to storing secrets. Nonetheless,
configuration data often contains a variety of secrets such as SSH
keys, TLS/SSL keys, and the tokens or credentials necessary to
authenticate to external APIs and services.

Similarly, on the end user front, the need for suitable secret-storage
systems is being driven by a rapid expansion of the number of sites
and services to which users must authenticate themselves and the
growing expanse of digital data and computing devices users wish to
protect. Indeed, the popularity of password management systems such as
LastPass~\cite{lastpass} or 1Password~\cite{onepassword} and the
increasing trend toward ``on-by-default'' device-encryption
demonstrate the importance of secret-storage and the applications it
enables to end users.

\subsection{Motivating Examples}

There are a number of motivating examples that highlight the potential
usefulness of a general purpose secure secret-storage system:

\begin{packed_desc}
\item[Encrypted File Lockers:] Cloud file locker services such as
  Dropbox~\cite{dropbox} or Google Drive~\cite{google-drive} provide a
  popular mechanism through which users may upload arbitrary files in
  order to sync them across multiple devices or to share them with
  other users. Such services, however, require the user to place a
  high degree of trust in third party storage
  providers~\cite{sayler-trust}. To mitigate such trust, users could
  employ various forms of client-side encryption, but doing so
  introduces a number of challenging encryption-key management
  problems that complicate the sharing and syncing use cases inherent
  to such services. Coupling client-side encryption systems with a
  distributed secret storage system, however, has the potential to
  reduce the degree to which users must trust third parties while also
  preserving straightforward syncing and sharing paradigms.
\item[Datacenter Disk Encryption:] Full disk encryption systems such
  as dm-crypt~\cite{dm-crypt} are useful for protecting operating
  systems and the data they store from unauthorized access or
  manipulation. Such systems, however, traditionally require a human
  to manually enter a secret in order to boot the system -- a
  requirement that makes full disk encryption largely unusable in
  deployments where no human can reasonably be expected to be
  physically present at boot time (e.g., on a headless remote server
  or atop third party cloud infrastructure). A secret-storage system
  capable of providing the necessary disk encryption key at boot and
  extending, by proxy, the ``human-in-the-loop'' boot requirement
  beyond mere physical presence (e.g., by sending a text message
  challenge to an administrator's cell phone) has the potential to
  expand the use of such encryption systems even in modern remote
  deployments.
\item[Password Management:] As mentioned, the growth of the number of
  passwords users must recall on a daily basis forces users to either
  choose low quality passwords, to reuse passwords across multiple
  services, or to place a high degree of trust in a third party
  password management services. A distributed secret storage service,
  however, has the potential to provide services similar to those
  provided by third party password managers, but with a lower degree
  of third party trust.
\end{packed_desc}

\subsection{The Ideal Secret-Storage System}

To address use cases such as these, users require a mechanism for
securely storing, managing, and exchanging a wide range of
secrets. Unlike standard configuration management systems, or even
specific secret-storage systems such as traditional password managers,
general purpose secret-storage presents a number of unique
requirements. These include the following capabilities:

\begin{packed_item}
\item Store arbitrary secret data.
\item Secure the manner in which secrets are stored.
\item Enforce fine-grained access control requirements.
\item Support a range of authentication sources/methods.
\item Provide audit logs tracking secret-access history.
\end{packed_item}

In response to these needs, a number of general purpose secret-storage
systems have recently been developed by industry, including
HashiCorp's Vault~\cite{vault}, Lyft's Confidant~\cite{confidant}, and
Square's Keywhiz~\cite{keywhiz}. These systems exist to fulfill some
or all of the requirements listed above. We believe, however, that
such systems are hindered by several key limitations. First, they
generally require at least one fully trusted server as the basis of
their security model, making them unsuitable for operation atop
untrusted infrastructure. Second, they are designed for use within the
boundaries of a single administrative domain and require the user to
trust the administrators of that domain. Finally, they tend to lack
support for use cases requiring autonomous or remote access to secret
material in a secure manner. These deficiencies give rise to several
additional secret-storage requirements:

\begin{packed_item}
\item Avoidance of the need to place a high degree of trust in any
  single system or administrative domain.
\item Ability to support a range of secret-access use cases, including
  use cases where automatic or remote access to secrets is required.
\end{packed_item}

It is toward these final two requirements that Tutamen attempts to
advance the state of the art over existing secret-storage systems. In
particular, Tutamen supports operational modes where no single entity
other than the client application must be trusted. This allows users
to leverage third party secret-storage providers running Tutamen
servers without having to place high degrees of trust in any single
provider. Tutamen is also designed to scale beyond a single
administrative domain, and does not require centralized control or
administration of each server in a Tutamen deployment. This capability
makes it possible to employ Tutamen in loosely organized environments
or across the Internet in general. Furthermore, Tutamen provides
support for a modular authentication interface. This interface makes
Tutamen suitable for use in situations where it is desirable to
leverage external environmental information to automatically evaluate
the authenticity of a secret-request or where it is necessary to keep
a human in the authentication loop without actually requiring that the
human be physically present. The remainder of this paper discusses
Tutamen's design and how it can be applied to solve issues such as
those raised here.
