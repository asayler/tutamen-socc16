\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

How best to store and manage secrets -- the bits of tightly controlled
data necessary to ensure or bootstrap the security of computing
systems and services -- has always been a non-trivial problem. As we
continue to move toward computing and storage platforms controlled by
third parties and embrace modern trends toward ephemeral
infrastructure, the secret storage problem only becomes more prevalent
and critical to solve.

Tutamen\footnote{Latin -- A means of protection or defense.} is our
attempt to solve the secret storage problem in a manner that allows
the user to adhere to a range of security and privacy requirements
without sacrificing functionality in the process. Tutamen is a next
generation secret storage platform. It builds on our previous secret
storage efforts~\cite{custos-trios} and strives to offer features not
provided by the various secret storage systems currently in use. In
particular, Tutamen focuses on two key secret storage features absent
from other systems -- the ability to support contextual and
out-of-band (OOB) authentication mechanisms and the avoidance of any
``single-point-of-trust'' requirements.

\subsection{The Need for Secret Storage}

The pervasiveness of computing systems today invades every contour of
our lives -- from the fitness trackers on our wrists, to our ``smart''
home appliances, to the server infrastructure required to support the
range of web sites and services we interact with every day. With this
explosion of computing systems has come an equally large explosion in
the amount of data stored by and about us. While some of this data is
designed to be public (i.e. the entries on Wikipedia), much of it is
not -- requiring the enforcement of various privacy and security
guarantees with respect to its handling and storage. The basis of
proving such guarantees relies on our ability to store and selectively
share secrets ranging from the keys used to encrypt our data or serve
it over a secure connection to the passwords used to protect our
online accounts. How best to store and manage these secrets is thus a
significant question -- the answer to which forms the foundation to
all of computing's higher level security and privacy
guarantees.

Beyond those mentioned above, there are several other factors driving
the need for good solution to the secret storage problem. On the
system administration front, the trend toward ephemeral infrastructure
cable of rapidly scaling up or down is driving the need for suitable
configuration management systems capable of converting configuration
metadata into fully configured systems. Systems such as
puppet~\cite{puppet} or chef~\cite{chef} allow administrators to
efficiently manage and configure large fleets of ephemeral
systems. Such systems, however, do not tend to have suitable
mechanisms for enforcing the security and privacy requirements
inherent to storing secrets. And yet configuration data often contains
a variety of secrets including cryptographic secrets such a SSH keys,
TLS/SSL keys, and disk or file encryption keys as well as Tokens or
credentials necessary to authenticate to a variety of external APIs
and services.

Similarly, on the end-user front, the need for suitable secret storage
systems is being driven by the rapid expansion in the number of sites
and services to which user must authenticate themselves as well as by
the growing expanse of digital data users wish to protect. Indeed, the
popularity of password management systems such as
LastPass~\cite{lastpass} or 1Password~\cite{onepassword} as well as
users desire for encryption support on their
devices~\cite{intercept-cookencryption} demonstrate the importance of
secret storage and the and the applications it enables to end users.

\subsection{The Ideal Secret Storage System}

Unlike standard configuration management systems, or even specific
secret storage systems such as password managers, a general purpose
secret storage presents a number of unique requirements including:

\begin{packed_item}
\item The ability to store a wide-range of arbitrary secret data
\item The ability to store data in a secure manner
\item The ability to enforce fine-grained access control requirements
\item The ability to support a range of authentication sources and methods
\item The ability to provide audit logs tracking data access history
\end{packed_item}

In response to these needs, a number of general purpose secret-storage
systems have been recently developed including HashiCorp's
Vault~\cite{vault}, Lyft's Confidant~\cite{confidant}, and Square's
Keywhiz~\cite{keywhiz}. These systems exist to fulfill some or all of
the requirements listed above. We believe, however, that such systems
are hindered by several key limitations. First, they generally require
at least one trusted system as the basis of their security model,
making them unsuitable for operation atop untrusted
infrastructure. Second, they tend to lack support for use cases
requiring autonomous or remote access to secret material in a secure
manner. These deficiencies give rise to a few more secret
storage requirements:

\begin{packed_item}
\item Avoidance of needing to place a high degree of trust in any
  single system outside the client application that wishes to store a
  secret.
\item Ability to support a range of secret access use-cases -
  including use cases where automatic or remote access may be required.
\end{packed_item}

It is toward these final two requirements that Tutamen attempts to
provide advancements over existing secret storage systems. In
particular, Tutamen supports operational modes where no single entity
other than the client must be trusted. This allows users to leverage
third party secret storage providers running Tutamen servers without
having to place high degrees of trust in any single provider. Tutamen
has also been developed with support for a modular out-of-band
authentication interface. This interface makes Tutamen suitable for
use in situations where it is desirable to leverage external
environmental information to to keep a human in the authentication
loop without actually requiring that the human be physically present
or connected to the application requesting a secret. For example,
Tutamen can be used to store the disk encryption keys required to boot
a physical server of virtual machine and to only release these keys to
the server requesting them when a human responds to a text message
confirming the boot request.
