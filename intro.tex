\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

How best to store and manage secrets -- the bits of sensitive data
necessary to ensure or bootstrap the security of computing systems and
services -- has always been a non-trivial problem. As we continue to
move toward computing and storage platforms controlled by third
parties, and embrace modern trends toward ephemeral infrastructure,
the secret-storage problem only becomes more prevalent and critical to
solve.

Tutamen\footnote{Latin for ``A means of protection or defense''.} is
our attempt to solve the secret-storage problem in a manner that
allows the user to adhere to a range of security and privacy
requirements without sacrificing functionality in the process. Tutamen
is a next-generation secret-storage platform. It builds on our
previous secret-storage efforts~\cite{custos-trios} as well as various
secret-storage systems available today~\cite{vault, keywhiz,
  confidant}.

In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation
of a secret-storage system with support for several novel features. We
also provide Several practical demonstrations of how a secret-storage
system with such features can be integrated with real-world
applications to offer desirable features in a secure and easy-to-use
manner. Tutaman's primary selling-points include:
\begin{packed_item}
\item A modular authentication system designed to support contextual,
  multi-factor, and alternate-band (e.g., SMS text messages)
  authentication mechanisms.
\item The ability to operate atop minimally trusted infrastructure
  by leveraging multiple storage and access control providers to
  achieve both redundancy and to mitigate trust.
\item The ability to share and manage secrets beyond the boundaries
  of a single administrative domain.
\end{packed_item}

\subsection{The Need for Secret-Storage}

Computing systems today invade every contour of our lives, from the
fitness trackers on our wrists, to our ``smart'' home appliances, to
the server infrastructure required to support the range of web sites
and services we interact with every day. With this explosion of
computing systems has come an equally large explosion in the amount of
data stored by and about us. While some of this data is designed to be
public (e.g., the entries on Wikipedia), much of it is not, requiring
the enforcement of various privacy and security guarantees with
respect to its handling and storage. The basis of providing such
guarantees relies on our ability to store and selectively share
secrets ranging from the keys used to encrypt our data to the
passwords used to protect our online accounts. How best to store and
manage these secrets is thus a critical question; the answer to which
forms the foundation to all of computing's higher level security and
privacy guarantees.

Beyond the need to bootstrap a variety of security guarantees, there
are several other factors driving the need for robust secret-storage
solutions. On the systems administration front, the trend toward
ephemeral infrastructure capable of rapidly scaling up or down is
driving the adoption of configuration management systems such as
Puppet~\cite{puppet} or Chef~\cite{chef}. Such systems, however, do
not tend to have suitable mechanisms for enforcing the security and
privacy requirements inherent to storing secrets. Nonetheless,
configuration data often contains a variety of secrets such as SSH
keys, TLS/SSL keys, file encryption keys, and the tokens or
credentials necessary to authenticate with external APIs and services.

Similarly, on the end user front, the need for suitable secret-storage
systems is being driven by a rapid expansion of the number of sites
and services to which users must authenticate themselves and the
growing expanse of digital data and computing devices users wish to
protect. Indeed, the popularity of password management systems such as
LastPass~\cite{lastpass} or 1Password~\cite{onepassword} and the
increasing trend toward ``on-by-default'' device-encryption
demonstrate the importance of secret-storage, and the applications it
enables, to end users.

\subsection{The Ideal Secret-Storage System}

Unlike standard configuration management systems, or even specific
secret-storage systems such as password managers, a general purpose
secret-storage presents a number of unique requirements, including the
following capabilities:

\begin{packed_item}
\item Store arbitrary secret data
\item Secure the manner in which such data is stored
\item Enforce fine-grained access control requirements
\item Support a range of authentication sources/methods
\item Provide audit logs tracking secret-access history
\end{packed_item}

In response to these needs, a number of general purpose secret-storage
systems have been recently developed by industry, including
HashiCorp's Vault~\cite{vault}, Lyft's Confidant~\cite{confidant}, and
Square's Keywhiz~\cite{keywhiz}. These systems exist to fulfill some
or all of the requirements listed above. We believe, however, that
such systems are hindered by several key limitations. First, they
generally require at least one fully trusted server as the basis of
their security model, making them unsuitable for operation atop
untrusted infrastructure. Second, they are designed for use within the
boundaries of a single administrative domain, and require the user to
trust the administrators of that domain. Finally, they tend to lack
support for use cases requiring autonomous or remote access to secret
material in a secure manner. These deficiencies give rise to a few
more secret-storage requirements:

\begin{packed_item}
\item Avoidance of the need to place a high degree of trust in any
  single system or administrative domain.
\item Ability to support a range of secret-access use cases, including
  use cases where automatic or remote access to secrets is required.
\end{packed_item}

It is toward these final two requirements that Tutamen attempts to
advance the state of the art over existing secret-storage systems. In
particular, Tutamen supports operational modes where no single entity
other than the client application must be trusted. This allows users
to leverage third party secret-storage providers running Tutamen
servers without having to place high degrees of trust in any single
provider. Tutamen is also designed to scale beyond a single
administrative domain, and does not require centralized control or
administration of each server in a Tutamen deployment. Tutamen also
provides support for a modular authentication interface. This
interface makes Tutamen suitable for use in situations where it is
desirable to leverage external environmental information to
automatically evaluate the authenticity of a secret-request or where
it is necessary to keep a human in the authentication loop without
actually requiring that the human be physically present. For example,
Tutamen can be used to store the disk encryption keys required to boot
a headless server, and only release these keys to the server
requesting them when a human responds to a text message confirming the
boot request.
