\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

How best to store and manage secrets -- the bits of tightly controlled
data necessary to ensure or bootstrap the security of computing
systems and services -- has always been a non-trivial problem. As we
continue to move toward computing and storage platforms controlled by
third parties, and embrace modern trends toward ephemeral
infrastructure, the secret-storage problem only becomes more prevalent
and critical to solve.

Tutamen\footnote{Latin -- A means of protection or defense.} is our
attempt to solve the secret-storage problem in a manner that allows
the user to adhere to a range of security and privacy requirements
without sacrificing functionality in the process. Tutamen is a next
generation secret-storage platform. It builds on our previous secret
storage efforts~\cite{custos-trios} and strives to offer features not
provided by the various secret-storage systems available today. In
this paper, we offer several contributions:

\begin{packed_item}
\item The design, implementation, and evaluation of a secret-storage
  system with support for several novel features, including:
  \begin{packed_item}
  \item Modular authentication modules designed to add flexibility
    through the use of contextual, multi-factor, and alternate-band
    (e.g., SMS text messages) authentication mechanisms.
  \item The ability to operate atop minimally trusted infrastructure
    by leveraging multiple storage and access control providers to
    achieve both redundancy and to mitigate trust.
  \end{packed_item}
\item Several practical demonstrations of how a secret-storage system
  with such features can be integrated with real-world applications to
  offer desirable features in a secure and easy-to-use manner.
\end{packed_item}

\subsection{The Need for Secret-Storage}

Computing systems today invade every contour of our lives -- from the
fitness trackers on our wrists, to our ``smart'' home appliances, to
the server infrastructure required to support the range of web sites
and services we interact with every day. With this explosion of
computing systems has come an equally large explosion in the amount of
data stored by and about us. While some of this data is designed to be
public (i.e., the entries on Wikipedia), much of it is not, requiring
the enforcement of various privacy and security guarantees with
respect to its handling and storage. The basis of providing such
guarantees relies on our ability to store and selectively share
secrets ranging from the keys used to encrypt our data to the
passwords used to protect our online accounts. How best to store and
manage these secrets is thus a critical question -- the answer to
which forms the foundation to all of computing's higher level security
and privacy guarantees.

Beyond the need to bootstrap a variety of security guarantees, there
are several other factors driving the need for robust secret storage
solutions. On the system administration front, the trend toward
ephemeral infrastructure capable of rapidly scaling up or down is
driving the adoption of configuration management systems such as
Puppet~\cite{puppet} or Chef~\cite{chef}. Such systems, however, do
not tend to have suitable mechanisms for enforcing the security and
privacy requirements inherent to storing secrets. Despite this,
configuration data often contains a variety of secrets such as SSH
keys, TLS/SSL keys, file encryption keys, and the tokens or
credentials necessary to authenticate with external APIs and services.

Similarly, on the end user front, the need for suitable secret-storage
systems is being driven by a rapid expansion of the number of sites
and services to which users must authenticate themselves, as well as
by the growing expanse of digital data users wish to protect. Indeed,
the popularity of password management systems such as
LastPass~\cite{lastpass} or 1Password~\cite{onepassword} as well as
user and manufacturer demands for encryption support on their
devices~\cite{apple-fbiletter} demonstrate the importance of secret
storage, and the applications it enables, to end users.

\subsection{The Ideal Secret-Storage System}

Unlike standard configuration management systems, or even specific
secret-storage systems such as password managers, a general purpose
secret-storage presents a number of unique requirements, including the
following capabilities:

\begin{packed_item}
\item Store a wide-range of arbitrary secret data
\item Store secret data in a secure manner
\item Enforce fine-grained access control requirements
\item Support a range of authentication sources/methods
\item Provide audit logs tracking secret access history
\end{packed_item}

In response to these needs, a number of general purpose secret-storage
systems have been recently developed by industry, including
HashiCorp's Vault~\cite{vault}, Lyft's Confidant~\cite{confidant}, and
Square's Keywhiz~\cite{keywhiz}. These systems exist to fulfill some
or all of the requirements listed above. We believe, however, that
such systems are hindered by several key limitations. First, they
generally require at least one fully trusted server as the basis of
their security model, making them unsuitable for operation atop
untrusted infrastructure. Second, they tend to lack support for use
cases requiring autonomous or remote access to secret material in a
secure manner. These deficiencies give rise to a few more secret
storage requirements:

\begin{packed_item}
\item Avoidance of the need to place a high degree of trust in any
  single system outside the application that wishes to store a secret.
\item Ability to support a range of secret access use cases, including
  use cases where automatic or remote access to secrets is required.
\end{packed_item}

It is toward these final two requirements that Tutamen attempts to
advance the state of the art over existing secret-storage systems. In
particular, Tutamen supports operational modes where no single entity
other than the application must be trusted. This allows users to
leverage third party secret-storage providers running Tutamen servers
without having to place high degrees of trust in any single
provider. Tutamen also provides support for a modular authentication
interface. This interface makes Tutamen suitable for use in situations
where it is desirable to leverage external environmental information
to automatically evaluate the authenticity of a secret request or
where it is necessary to keep a human in the authentication loop
without actually requiring that the human be physically present. For
example, Tutamen can be used to store the disk encryption keys
required to boot a headless server, and only release these keys to the
server requesting them when a human responds to a text message
confirming the boot request.
