\section{Applications}
\label{sec:apps}

Tutamen is designed to support a wide range of applications. We have
integrated our reference Tutamen design with a set of common
applications for the purpose of demonstrating the value derived from
using a secure storage system such as Tutamen. These applications all
leverage Tutamen's flexibility to achieve functionality that would
have been difficult or impossible to achieve without using a system
like Tutamen.

\subsection{Block Device Encryption}

Block device encryption systems are a popular means of protecting the
data stored on computing systems in the event that the system is lost,
stolen, or otherwise physically compromised.  Block-level encryption
systems such as dm-crypt~\cite{dm-crypt} (generally coupled with the
Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS)~\cite{luks} container) or the
QEMU~\cite{qemu} qcow2 encryption system provide methods for securing
the data stored on laptops, desktops, and VMs. Such systems
traditionally bootstrap security by requiring the user to enter a
password at boot-time to unlock a locally stored encryption key which
is then used to decrypt the block device in question. Unfortunately,
the ``human-at-keyboard'' security root make such systems difficult or
impossible to use atop headless servers or in related situations where
no human can be expected to be present at boot-time. We've leveraged
Tutamen to overcome this barrier.

To add Tutamen-support to LUKS/dm-crypt we've created a Tutamen-aware
implementation~\cite{src-tutamen-askpassword} of the \texttt{systemd}
Password Agent Specification~\cite{systemd-passwordagents}. This
specification is used by LUKS/dm-crypt \texttt{cryptsetup} utility to
request the necessary decryption secret. At boot time,
\texttt{cryptsetup} will send out a request for this secret. Normally
this triggers a ``human-at-keyboard'' prompt for a boot
pass-phrase. Our Tutamen-aware password agent can instead respond to
such requests by retrieving the necessary decryption secret from a
Tutamen storage server (after first retrieving the necessary tokens
from the corresponding Tutamen AC server). In addition to modifying
the ask-password utility, we made several modifications to the
\texttt{initrd} creation process to add Tutamen networking support,
the necessary Tutamen client TLS key pair, and a config file
specifying which Tutamen servers to use and the UUIDs of the relevant
Tutamen collection and secrets.

We've also integrated Tutamen support with QEMU to provide qcow2
encryption keys when a VM boots~\cite{src-qemu-tutamen}. Similar to
the dm-crypt setup, QEMU normally requires the user to provide the
encryption key via the QEMU console when a VM launches. Our system
replaces this ``human-at-keyboard'' process with Tutamen-based secret
retrieval. In addition, QEMU currently requires the user to provide
the full encryption key, not just a pass-phrase to unlock a pre-stored
key~\cite{berrange-qemucrypto}. This has negative security
repercussions in the common case where users pick short password-like
keys. Using Tutamen, we can overcome this barrier since Tutamen
servers have no qualms about needing to store or remember sufficiently
long encryption keys. Our system thus increases both QEMU's security
and its ease of use.

Using these setups, we're able to boot servers and VM images with
encrypted disks without requiring a human to be physically present at
the machine. In cases where we still desire human approval of the boot
process, we can leverage our SMS authenticator module to get an
on-demand confirmation from a designated human as a prerequisite to
Tutamen releasing the correct key. This allows us to gain the same
level of human-in-the-loop security provided by a typed pass-phrase,
but without actually requiring a human to go to the datacenter to type
one in. In situations where we don't desire a human-in-the-loop at
all, we envision automating the approval process via the use of
time-of-day and IP-source authenticators.

\subsection{Encrypted Cloud File Locker}

Cloud-based file lockers such as Dropbox~\cite{dropbox} are extremely
popular today. Unfortunately, these systems require users to trust the
cloud provider with full access to their (generally unencrypted)
data. Users wishing to overcome this deficiency can optionally encrypt
all of their data on the client before syncing it to the file locker
provider, but doing so does not generally interact well with such
services' sharing and multi-device use cases, requiring users to
employ manual, out-of-band key exchange mechanisms to share or sync
their encrypted files. We don't believe file locker users should have
to choose between easily syncing or sharing their files and using
encryption to protect their data.

Tutamen provides a solution to this problem by offering a secure
key-sharing mechanism. Instead of manually distributing or sharing
encryption keys, the user can store their key as a Tutamen secret and
leverage Tutamen's access control features to share the secret with
the accounts of their friends. This entire process could even be
automated such that when a user shares a file via Dropbox, the
corresponding encryption key is automatically shared via Tutamen.

Toward this end, we have created FuseBox: an alternate Dropbox client
that performs client-side encryption of all Dropbox files, storing the
corresponding encryption keys on our reference Tutamen server. FuseBox
achieves goals similar to those achieved by~\cite{goh2003}, but
without requiring out-of-band key management. Similar to other
file-system-level encryption systems~\cite{blaze1993, Cattaneo2001,
  halcrow}, FuseBox provides transparent file encryption to end
users. In order to avoid the storage space and security challenges
presented by locally caching all Dropbox data (i.e., the operation mode
for the official Dropbox client), FuseBox uses AES~\cite{daemen1999,
  nist2001} as a stream cipher to transparently stream and encrypted
data to/from Dropbox's servers on demand.  The source code for our
FuseBox implementation is available at~\cite{fusebox}.

Since FuseBox leverages Tutamen to store each per-file encryption key,
it becomes possible to share an encrypted file via Dropbox, share its
encryption key via Tutamen, and achieve the same level of
functionality traditional Dropbox users have without having to expose
one's data to Dropbox. While the key sharing process in FuseBox is not
yet directly synced with Dropbox's file sharing system, the Tutamen
CLI can be used to quickly share the encryption keys between users. In
this manner, we've used FuseBox to store and share encrypted files
with nearly the same ease with which one might use the traditional
unencrypted Dropbox client. By leveraging Tutamen, FuseBox also gains
the ability to remotely revoke file access, e.g., in the case a device
is lost or stolen, similar to systems such as~\cite{geambasu2011}. We
also have plans to add cryptographic file authentication to FuseBox's
streaming architecture using techniques such as those described
at~\cite{McGrew2005}. FuseBox, via Tutamen's distributed operation
mode, also avoids the sharing pitfalls associated many existing
``secure cloud storage'' providers~\cite{wilson2014} by avoiding
reliance on a single trusted party to facilitate sharing operations.

\subsection{Other}

Since our Tutamen-capable ask-password port speaks the standard
systemd Password Agent protocol, it can also be used to provide
Tutamen-backed pass-phrase storage to any applications leveraging this
protocol, including OpenVPN and various password storage utilities. We
have not yet thoroughly explored these use cases, but we envision a
Tutamen-passed systemd password agent being useful in a wide range of
situations beyond just full disk encryption. Our experience
integrating the systemd password agent with Tutamen also suggests that
Tutamen would provide a useful backend for a variety of other
``agent'' protocols (e.g.,~\cite{cox2002, ylonen1996}).
