+ Discuss key rotation and certificate revocation
- Trim Section 2 - too much tangential info, focus on Auth and Storage
+ Discuss how SS/ACS servers are added removed (migrated, decommissioned)
+ Discuss incremental scaling
+ Discuss client cert revocation
+ Diagram relationship between clients, accounts, and certs

+ Reference CleanOS (OSDI'12) and TinMan (EuroSys'15)
+ Reference kerberos for token mechanism
+ Discuss placing both ACS and SS on a single machine
+ Why two servers? Separation of duties
+ Figure 5 (storing secret) too small
+ Explain Figure 5 handshack process
+ Figure 2 uses many undefined abbreviations; defined in the caption
+ The top of page 6 refers to "a novel ($k,n$) threshold scheme."
  Say "novel yet simple"
+ Footnote 2 ends by claiming that the ID-grabbing DOS attack isn't
  worth worrying about.  Those sound like famous last words.  In
  any case, why can't an application just request a different ID?
  The entire process of generating IDs is inadequately specified.
+ Section 3.3 argues that service providers who do a bad job of
  being secure "will suffer a negative economic effect,
  disincentivizing such behavior."  This is the type of wishful
  thinking that is popular with economists; it's not a valid
  security argument.  There are plenty of counterexamples in the
  real world, and in any case the argument rests on the assumption
  of a fully informed client base.  The paper would do better to
  simply omit that paragraph and instead admit that Tutamen still
  has risks, but that (a) it is better than current alternatives
  and (b) sharding secrets sufficiently widely can arbitrarily
  reduce risk.
+ The authors consistently use an en dash, separated by spaces, to
  set off parenthetical comments (except in one place where they
  use a hyphen).  Correct typography calls for an em dash with no
  spaces; see Lamport p. 14.  Also, in at least two places the
  parenthetical begins with an en dash but is terminated by a
  comma, which is also correct.  In other words, you should write
  parentheticals--also known as asides--like this, rather than
  writing them--incorrectly, like this.
+ At the beginning of Section 2.1 is the phrase "...for
  authenticating secret requests".  That would normally be read as
  "authenticating requests that are kept secret".  Rephrasing to
  "authenticating requests for secrets" would be clearer.
+ Page 6, column 2, the second paragraph contains a lengthy
  unparseable sentence: "The Tutamen authenticator interface..."  A
  rewrite would be most helpful to the reader.
+ Surely there's a better title for Section 4.3 than "Other".
+ Fix hyphens
  * secret-storage platform
  * access-control server
+ Typographic errors that won't be caught by a spell-checker:
    * "in order to" -> "to"
    * "as well as" -> "and"
    * syncing -> synchronizing
    * "human-at-keyboard" -> "human-at-the-keyboard".
