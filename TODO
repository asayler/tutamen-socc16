+ The authors consistently use an en dash, separated by spaces, to
  set off parenthetical comments (except in one place where they
  use a hyphen).  Correct typography calls for an em dash with no
  spaces; see Lamport p. 14.  Also, in at least two places the
  parenthetical begins with an en dash but is terminated by a
  comma, which is also correct.  In other words, you should write
  parentheticals--also known as asides--like this, rather than
  writing them--incorrectly, like this.
+ Surely there's a better title for Section 4.3 than "Other".
+ Fix hyphens
  * secret-storage platform

+ Typographic errors that won't be caught by a spell-checker:
    * "in order to" -> "to"
    * "as well as" -> "and"
    * syncing -> synchronizing
    * "human-at-keyboard" -> "human-at-the-keyboard".
