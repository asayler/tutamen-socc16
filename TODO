+ Figure 5 too small
+ Explain Figure 5 handshack process
+ Section 3.2: $n-k+1$ error ($n-k+1$ = robustness,  k = compromise)
+ Figure 2 uses many undefined abbreviations; defined in the caption
+ The top of page 6 refers to "a novel ($k,n$) threshold scheme."
  Say "novel yet simple"
+ Footnote 2 ends by claiming that the ID-grabbing DOS attack isn't
  worth worrying about.  Those sound like famous last words.  In
  any case, why can't an application just request a different ID?
  The entire process of generating IDs is inadequately specified.
+ Section 3.3 argues that service providers who do a bad job of
  being secure "will suffer a negative economic effect,
  disincentivizing such behavior."  This is the type of wishful
  thinking that is popular with economists; it's not a valid
  security argument.  There are plenty of counterexamples in the
  real world, and in any case the argument rests on the assumption
  of a fully informed client base.  The paper would do better to
  simply omit that paragraph and instead admit that Tutamen still
  has risks, but that (a) it is better than current alternatives
  and (b) sharding secrets sufficiently widely can arbitrarily
  reduce risk.
+ Figure 8 is insufficiently explained.  In the first place, the
  chosen axes are a bit odd, although I guess the X axis is
  intended to represent applied load.  But why does the latency
  initially drop as the load rises?  Why do the curves all stop at
  different points?  (Was the next point off the charts?  Were the
  tests arbitrarily stopped at that point?  Or did the authors
  simply decide that the following point was on the graph but
  unacceptable?)
+ The experimental evaluation is sketchy at best, and vaguely
  described.  What is the "2011-era" machine?  What is its clock
  rate?  How much memory does the host have?  How fast is its
  network connection?  How many experimental runs were done?  (The
  standard deviations in Figure 8 are meaningless without knowing
  the run count; in any case it would be better to give confidence
  intervals.)
+ The authors consistently use an en dash, separated by spaces, to
  set off parenthetical comments (except in one place where they
  use a hyphen).  Correct typography calls for an em dash with no
  spaces; see Lamport p. 14.  Also, in at least two places the
  parenthetical begins with an en dash but is terminated by a
  comma, which is also correct.  In other words, you should write
  parentheticals--also known as asides--like this, rather than
  writing them--incorrectly, like this.
+ At the beginning of Section 2.1 is the phrase "...for
  authenticating secret requests".  That would normally be read as
  "authenticating requests that are kept secret".  Rephrasing to
  "authenticating requests for secrets" would be clearer.
+ Page 6, column 2, the second paragraph contains a lengthy
  unparseable sentence: "The Tutamen authenticator interface..."  A
  rewrite would be most helpful to the reader.
+ Surely there's a better title for Section 4.3 than "Other".
+ Figure 7 requires color to be interpreted.  The CFP explicitly
  requires figures to be legible in monochrome.
+ I would argue that human-scale times (bottom of p. 10) are hours,
  not seconds.  A human might be asleep when a text message comes
  in.
