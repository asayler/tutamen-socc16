+ Discuss key rotation and certificate revocation

+ Discuss how SS/ACS servers are added removed (migrated, decommissioned)
+ Discuss incremental scaling
+ Emphasize Dropbox integration
+ Add related work section
+ Reference CleanOS (OSDI'12) and TinMan (EuroSys'15)
+ Discuss placing both ACS and SS on a single machine
+ Why two servers? Separation of duties
+ Section 3.3 argues that service providers who do a bad job of
  being secure "will suffer a negative economic effect,
  disincentivizing such behavior."  This is the type of wishful
  thinking that is popular with economists; it's not a valid
  security argument.  There are plenty of counterexamples in the
  real world, and in any case the argument rests on the assumption
  of a fully informed client base.  The paper would do better to
  simply omit that paragraph and instead admit that Tutamen still
  has risks, but that (a) it is better than current alternatives
  and (b) sharding secrets sufficiently widely can arbitrarily
  reduce risk.
+ The authors consistently use an en dash, separated by spaces, to
  set off parenthetical comments (except in one place where they
  use a hyphen).  Correct typography calls for an em dash with no
  spaces; see Lamport p. 14.  Also, in at least two places the
  parenthetical begins with an en dash but is terminated by a
  comma, which is also correct.  In other words, you should write
  parentheticals--also known as asides--like this, rather than
  writing them--incorrectly, like this.
+ Surely there's a better title for Section 4.3 than "Other".
+ Fix hyphens
  * secret-storage platform
  * access-control server
+ Typographic errors that won't be caught by a spell-checker:
    * "in order to" -> "to"
    * "as well as" -> "and"
    * syncing -> synchronizing
    * "human-at-keyboard" -> "human-at-the-keyboard".
